According to Java conventions only the class definitions start with a capital
letter. Your methods on the other hand has to begin with a small letter.

```java
public static void YourStats(){
      System.out.println("HP = "+h+"\nDMG = "+dmg);
}
```

Like this

```java
public static void yourStats() {
  System.out.println("HP = "+h+"\nDMG = "+dmg);
}
```

It looks like you understand your logical operators quite good! Very nice.


Watch out for too generic naming of variables. `x` and `a` is not really good
descriptive variable names. You have to think every time that they have to make
sense in a vacuum. If people only knew the name of the variable they would know
what values probably would reside in it.


Other than that pretty good job so far!
