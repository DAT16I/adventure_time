Remember to give variables some names that distinguish them and explains what
could be inside of them. `d` is not a good name since in a vacuum, it would not
make much sense whereas `numberOfElevators` is a better name!


I would have liked to see you use some more logical operators such as `&&` and
`||`.


Good job!
