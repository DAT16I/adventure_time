Very good naming of methods!


You are actually writing some good comments but try and also stick to the
Java way of doing them for methods.

Remember to name your variables something meaningful. Even when looking at them
in a vacuum they need to make sense. aka. `x` does not make much sense.


Otherwise good job!
