Try to be consistent in your way of styling your code. Especially the
indentation suffers on multiple occasions.


It seems like you have your logical operators down. Very good.


Some functions with `return` statements would have been cool.


All in all a good program with a nice flow and nice usage of most of the
concept we have learned so far.
