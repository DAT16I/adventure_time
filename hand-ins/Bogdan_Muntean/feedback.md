Looks real good!
Good indentation, good flow, nice comments and even some return statements!

One small thing is try to enhance your consistency by adding curly brackets to
your `if else` statements.

```java
if(val == false)
   break;
```

Even though they are on liners they deserve the special attention of the curly
brackets! :)

```java
if(val == false) {
   break;
}
```


Very nice job Bogdan. Keep up the good work.
