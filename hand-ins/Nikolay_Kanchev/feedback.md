This method is not taking in any parameters so your comments does not match up.
```java
/*
 * The player have to register.
 * @param firstName stores the user input for the first name
 * @param lastName stores the user input for the last name
 * @param email stores the user input for the e-mail
 * @param nickname stores the user input for the nickname
 * print all the variables
 */

public static void register (){
  String firstName;
  String lastName;
  String email;
  String nickname;
```

Your comments would have been correct if the method had taken in parameters.

Very nice!
