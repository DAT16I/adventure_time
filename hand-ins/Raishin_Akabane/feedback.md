Nice usage of method comments!


Quite good naming of variables and methods.


You also make good use of both parameters and return statements.


You also show good understanding of you conditional statements and your logical
operators!


All in all very nice and with the skills that you inhabit at the moment I do not
see how you should improve it more, other than having a bit nicer indentation.
