I would have liked to see you use some more logical operators such as `&&` and
`||`.


Otherwise I really like the flow of you application. It looks like you get all
the basic concepts.

I like that you actually are using comments. Try and be a bit more descriptive
though. There is no shame in "bloating" your code with comments if they help
you.


Good job!
