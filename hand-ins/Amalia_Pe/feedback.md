This looks really good for what it is.


A couple of places you have too watch your indentation but otherwise you are
very consistent, which is magnificent.


But as you stated yourself try to do it from the bottom up next time. It's
harder but you learn a fuck-ton about every little minute detail.


Try and use some more logical operators next time, such as `&&` and `||`.


Not much to say really. Good job!
