Remember to name your file exactly the same as your class. Otherwise it won't compile.


You have very good variable naming generally.


Holy shit that is a lot of code! All that taken into account this is a really
good first jump into programming.


With this much code I would have loved to see some more functions being used
to handle some of the complexity. But I think you guys did this before we
dived into `return` statements and parameters so it's understandable.


Very nice and very fun! Good job guys. Very good.
